Thus, selectively abstaining\\nfrom querying unsuitable LLMs for a given task\\nmay help improve the overall response quality\\nof such ensembles. Additionally, such an approach\\nwould implicitly save computation by accessing\\nfewer models per query.\\nIn this paper, we propose the SELECT LLM algo-\\nrithm to explore this idea. Our approach first learns\\nthe model-specific capabilities for different LLMs\\nthrough a dataset of diverse queries using a clas-\\nsifier. When performing inference for an unseen\\nquery, this insight is used to predict confidence\\nscores for each LLM in the model pool, represent-\\ning how likely they are to solve the underlying task.\\nWe create and test multiple selection policies that\\ndetermine the optimal set of LLMs for the given\\nquery based on their respective confidence scores.\\nOur findings indicate that the proposed system:\\n(i) Outperforms individual LLMs in terms of their\\naccuracy and (ii) Achieves competitive accuracy\\nscore with a similar sized top-performing subset\\nwhile significantly reducing latency costs. The\\ncontributions of our work are as follows:\\n•We introduce the novel SELECT LLM algo-\\nrithm, which is based on a multi-label clas-\\nsifier and an optimal confidence-based pol-\\nicy. This approach efficiently navigates input\\nqueries to the ideal subset of LLMs from a\\nlarger pool to improve response quality and\\nalso reduce computational costs in the process.\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first\\nstudy to propose LLM selection method.\\n•The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is eval-\\nuated on two challenging reasoning bench-\\nmarks. We report a gain of 6.67points on\\nGSM8K and 2.08points on MMLU in terms of\\naccuracy compared to the highest scoring in-\\ndividual LLMs in the corresponding model\\npools. We also report significantly lower laten-\\ncies (13% for GSM8K and 70% for MMLU ) com-\\npared to similar sized top-performing LLM\\nsubset from the pools.\\n•Through empirical analysis and ablation stud-\\nies across two datasets and 7 LLMs, we\\ndemonstrate that the proposed model is re-\\nliable, robust, and cost-efficient.2 Related Work\\nModel Diversity Recent surveys (Bommasani\\net al., 2021; Minaee et al., 2024) suggest that LLMs\\ncan develop emergent capabilities. Specifically,\\nthis means that models can show behavior and\\ndemonstrate skills beyond those explicitly taught.\\nBy virtue of changing the training data, models can\\nalso be trained to exhibit a wide variety of domain\\nexpertise. At the same time, Jiang et al. (2023)\\ndemonstrate that no single open-source LLM out-\\nperforms other models across popular benchmarks.\\nThis further motivates the need to develop ensem-\\nbling methods to improve the combined perfor-\\nmance of a pool of LLMs with diverse capabilities.\\nModel Selection Routing queries among LLMs\\ninvolves aligning their capabilities with the under-\\nlying tasks from the input queries. However, select-\\ning models for routing with LLMs differs from\\nthat in traditional ML (Bishop, 2006; Raschka,\\n2020) due to the disparity between the training\\nand test datasets. LLMs are trained on massive\\ncorpora with straightforward objectives like next-\\ntoken prediction (Brown et al., 2020), while test\\ndata often includes complex tasks like reasoning\\nand question answering (Hendrycks et al., 2021;\\nCobbe et al., 2021; Joshi et al., 2017), summariza-\\ntion (Tam et al., 2023), and classification (Zhang\\net al., 2023), which may not be prevalent in the\\ntraining data. This discrepancy makes it challeng-\\ning to assess the difficulties in resolving complex\\nqueries. Additionally, studies like Rabinovich et al.\\n(2023) and Srivatsa and Kochmar (2024) suggest\\nthat prompt characteristics such as length and read-\\nability can significantly impact an LLM’s ability to\\nhandle tasks.\\nLLM Ensembling Previous attempts at ensem-\\nbling and routing LLMs typically fall into two cat-\\negories: (1)Selecting the best response from multi-\\nple LLM generations, as seen in Liu and Liu (2021),\\nRavaut et al. (2022), and Jiang et al. (2023). How-\\never, this approach requires querying all LLMs in\\nthe model pool for each query during inference,\\nwhich can be computationally expensive with a\\nlarge number of LLMs. (2)Minimizing the num-\\nber of queries to larger LLMs to reduce latency and\\ncomputational costs, as demonstrated by Shnitzer\\net al. (2023) and Ding et al. (2024), who redirect\\nsimpler queries to the smallest model capable of\\nhandling the task to minimize querying costs with\\nminimal drop in performance.
